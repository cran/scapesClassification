Description: Series of algorithms to translate  users' mental models of seascapes, 
  landscapes and, more generally, of geographic features into computer representations 
  (classifications). Spaces and geographic objects are classified with user-defined 
  rules taking into account spatial data as well as spatial relationships among 
  different classes and objects.
